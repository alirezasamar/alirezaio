In July 2016, I start curating a newsletter to round-up all the news and variety of other categories like articles, videos, tips for beginners, books, studentships and jobs related to artificial intelligence and machine learning.

It might sound weird, since who is on the earth still reading a newsletter in the era of social medias and news paparazzi! Plus, why should you narrow down your target audience while you can have a broader topic and make some bucks!

Machine learning is not a new field of study at all, but its new approaches give this field another rise. The short way of saying it, people are also learning on how to optimize their training sets, or how to chose the best method for their data set.
Machine learning is all about learning from examples, rather than writing manual rules. In other words, in regular programming, you write a lot of manual rules to solve a problem, and in machine learning you let the algorithm figure out those rules for you from examples.

In the history, concreting a proper foundation always required the full commitment of all the minds in that study. I always remember a sentence from my primary school teacher that “The real value of knowledge is to sharing.” this statement clearly describes the importance of sharing, literally in any possible way.

Fast forward to today, I slowly understand that people are not ignoring newsletters because they’re annoying or inefficient, but because they’re auto-curated which leads to low-quality emails that probably you have also marked as spam!

### ML Weekly

With this in my mind, I found newsletter the fastest and direct way to deliver not also newest but also top-notch contents to those who are passionate about shaping a better future for humanity.

> A place to find amazing contents and reading extraordinary discoveries. I am very excited about it.
